Bit manipulation:

is a stream of 0's and 1's representing a particular data, be it string, character, integer...etc. This project demonstrates how binary representation of a specific data is stored in computer memory. This is described with various tasks worked in this project.

Learning Objectives:
- Look for the right source of information without too much help.
- How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators like: &, |, >>, <<, and ^

Requirements:
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All file should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code uses Betty style. And it is checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Global variables are not allowed to be used
- No file should contain more than 5 functions if need be.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of funcitons like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc... is forbidden unless otherwise stated.
- _putchar function is allowed to be used.
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in header file called main.h
- Header file should be committed to your repository
- All header files (if there is more than one) should be include guarded
