This project talks about functions and nested loops.
Functions is a small chunks of code that performs specific task (i.e one task)

Writing functions in C program entails the following steps:
1. Function definition or creation.
2. Function declaration.
3. Function invocation.

The above steps are only required only if function is written or defined in its own file. And such, its file is referenced at the top of calling file (example, like main.c file).

It is referenced by simply using #include directive: i.e
#include "func_file_name"
