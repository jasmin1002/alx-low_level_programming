This project demonstrates and describes FUNCTION POINTERS in C programming with practical use cases.

Learning Objectives:
- What are function pointers and how to use them
- What does a function pointer exactly hold
- Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

Requirements:
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- Code should use and adhere to the Betty style
- The prototypes of all defined functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called function_pointers.h
- Don't forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be included guarded
